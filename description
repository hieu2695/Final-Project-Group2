## DATA SOURCE
https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification/data

The data can be manually downloaded after accepting the competition rule.

Using Kaggle CLI command (requires Kaggle API token):

kaggle competitions download -c human-protein-atlas-image-classification

## Download from GCP

For convenience, I uploaded the data to my GCP so it can be downloaded using wget command.

Assuming that we are at the git repository Final-Project-Group2, else we need to move to the repo:

cd ~/Final-Project-Group2

At the git repo, download data via GCP using the command:

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/letranhieu-bucket-data/data.zip

Then, unzip the data.zip file:

unzip data.zip

The data will be unzipped to a folder named "data" containing "train" folder and "train.csv"
